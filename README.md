1. Stress management
2. Anxiety and panic disorder

4. Insomnia and sleep disturbance
5. Anger management
6. Grief and loss
7. Relationship problems and communication skills
8. Low self-esteem and negative self-image
9. Trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
10. Career and life purpose.


note to self : 
Incorporating the theories of Jung, Adler, and other psychological models could involve training the chatbot on texts that discuss these theories and
incorporating elements of these theories into the chatbot's responses. For example, you could include information about the role of the unconscious mind 
in stress and anxiety, as described by Jungian theory, or the importance of personal responsibility in overcoming challenges, as described by Adlerian theory.


To ponder and brainstorm: 
do i build a domain intent classifeir at the top?
how do i start the conversation?? should the intents be in an outerloop wherein the bot asks a question and the intent is classified and appropriate actions 
take place like asking prompting to fill a form?
