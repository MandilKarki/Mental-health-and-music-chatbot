note to self : 
Incorporating the theories of Jung, Adler, and other psychological models could involve training the chatbot on texts that discuss these theories and
incorporating elements of these theories into the chatbot's responses. For example, you could include information about the role of the unconscious mind 
in stress and anxiety, as described by Jungian theory, or the importance of personal responsibility in overcoming challenges, as described by Adlerian theory.
